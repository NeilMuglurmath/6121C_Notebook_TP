			\subsection{Preface}
					\begin{flushleft}
						\qquad This notebook is the story of
						team 6121C throughout the VEX 2018-19 season, Turning Point.
						It is designed to be an organized description of our design,
						build, and programming processes.

		% use of git
		\newpage
			\subsection{Use of Git Version Control}
					\begin{flushleft}
						\qquad Our use of Git has helped us keep track of our files.
						Everything electronic we do (code, CAD, etc.) is tracked using
						Git version control to keep track of the iterations those files
						have gone through.
					\end{flushleft}

		% use of LaTeX
		\newpage
			\subsection{Use of \LaTeX}
						\begin{flushleft}
							\qquad This year, we decided to use \LaTeX\ to make
							our notebook. This helps us have a cleaner notebook
							and use Git version control with it as well. \LaTeX\ is
							a typesetting system designed for technical and
							scientific documentation. We feel that using \LaTeX\ helped us
							be more efficient in documenting our team.

			\section{About the Team}
				\subsection{History of 6121C}
					\begin{flushleft}
						\qquad Team 6121C The Pioneers planted their seeds during
						the VRC 2016-17 season, Starstruck. Head by veteran roboteer
						Neil Muglurmath, they ranked 6th and earned the Tournament
						Semifinalist award in their first regional compeition
						of the season, qualifying them for the state qualifier. At the Eastern PA State
						Championship, they were semifinalists in their division and won
						the Build Award. \\

						\qquad The team stepped up their game in the VRC 2017-18 season,
						In The Zone. It was comprised of one member, Neil Muglurmath,
						for a large part of the season. In his first tournament of the season,
						he recieved the Tournament Semifinalist award. After a rebuild, he acquired
						both Tournament Champion and Excellence awards in his second regional compeition
						of the season. After improving upon his second iteration, he obtained the Excellence
						Award once again, along with being a Tournament Semifinalist. By now, 6121C had
						qualified for the CREATE U.S. Open Robotics Championship, which consists of 200 VRC
						teams around the country, but unfortunately there was no more space to compete. After
						a rebuild for the Eastern PA State Championship, the team took home the Tournament
						Champion Award, qualifying them for the VEX Robotics World Championship in
						Louisville, Kentucky. Here, they ended with a record of 5-5 and 44th in the
						Research Division.

				\subsubsection{Schoology}
					\begin{flushleft}
						\qquad Schoology is a Learning Management System used by the TE School District.
						Because students are already used to Schoology's UI,
						we thought it would be a good idea to use Schoology
						for communication within CHS Robotics. In Schoology,
						both the leaders of the club and the mentor are able to
						post updates about club meetings, compeitions, and more.

			\section{Game Rules}
				\subsection{Competition Rules}
					\begin{flushleft}
						\qquad VEX Robotics Competition Turning Point is
						played on a 12’x12’ square field. Two (2) Alliances – one (1) “red” and one (1) “blue” – composed of two (2) Teams each, compete in matches consisting of a fifteen (15) second Autonomous Period, followed by a one minute and forty-five second (1:45) Driver Controlled Period. \\

						\qquad The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by High Scoring or Low Scoring Caps, Toggling Flags, and by Alliance Parking or Center Parking Robots on the Platforms. \\

						\qquad There are eight (8) Caps, six (6) Posts, nine (9) Flags, twenty (20) Balls, two (2) Alliance Platforms, and one (1) Center Platform. \\


						\qquad Caps can be Low Scored on the field tiles, or High Scored on Posts, for the Alliance whose color is facing up at the end of the match. Flags can be Toggled to red or blue, and are Scored for the Alliance whose color is Toggled at the end of the match. Low Flags can be Toggled by Robots, but High Flags can only be Toggled by Balls. Turning Point is intended to be a back and forth game, no scored object is safe! \\


						\qquad Alliance Platforms can be used for Alliance Parking by Robots of the same color Alliance as the Platform. The Center Platform can be used by Robots from either Alliance for Center Parking. An additional bonus is awarded to the Alliance that has the most total points at the end of the Autonomous Period. \break

			% skills rules
			\newpage
				\subsection{Robot Skills Challenge Rules}
					\begin{flushleft}
						In this challenge, teams will compete in sixty (60) second long matches in an effort to score as many points as possible. These matches consist of Driving Skills Matches, which will be entirely driver controlled, and Programming Skills Matches, which will be autonomous with limited human interaction. Teams will be ranked based on their combined score in the two types of matches. The playing field will be set up similarly to that of a normal VEX Robotics Competition Turning Point match, with some modifications (see $<$RSC3$>$). \break

						\textbf{$<$RSC3$>$} In a Robot Skills Match, all Flags begin the Match Toggled for the blue Alliance, and all Caps start with the blue side facing upwards. A Team’s score for their Robot Skills Match will be determined by how many points are scored for the red Alliance at the end of the Match, i.e. how many Flags are Toggled to red, how many Caps are placed “red-up”, if the Robot is Alliance Parked on the red Alliance Platform, etc.
